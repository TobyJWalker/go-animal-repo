# local-animal-repo
This project is a re-write of my animal-repo but in Python, with the intent to be ran locally and accessed as a dashboard via browser. It will drop the need for accounts as it will be ran locally, and will serve as a simple way to keep track of your animals. It is not intended to store sensitive data so authentication is not required.

I will be trying to implement some javascript to make the dashboard more dynamic, but I am not sure how far I will go with this, as I am not a web developer and I have very little experience with JS.
